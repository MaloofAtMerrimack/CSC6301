This is the code repository for CSC 6301 at Merrimack College.

Week 4 collects integers for a linked list and outputs the sorted list.

Week 5 is similar to week 4, but the integers are stored in a stack.

Week 6 is creating this repository and uploading to it.

Week 7 is running CProfiler on a Prime number finder.
