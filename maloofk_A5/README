Changes from Week 4:
- imported Stack instead of LinkedList.
- Changed name of class from IntLinkedList to CreateList because while this is not good for a maintenence task, it'd be deceptive to have LinkedList in the class name when it uses Stack.
- Changed intsList from LinkedList to Stack. 

- The of the code is left the same
